# VIO-SLAM Module

The state-of-the-art SLAM methods are somewhat difficult to grasp due to their complexity and unexpected tight couplings / leaky abstractions when trying to find out what the main parts are. How they should play with visual-inertial tracking - what we already have - is also unclear. This repository contains a SLAM module implementation that tries to coherently include relevant aspects of the SLAM pipeline.

See the document [design-document.pdf](design-document.pdf) for details.

## License

This SLAM module is based on OpenVSLAM, which was initially claimed by its authors to be licensed under a BSD-style permissive license, but later taken offline due to possible GPL-licensing violation in connection to the ORB-SLAM codebase. Therefore, this module is not suitable for commercial use, see the file `openvslam/README.md` for more details.
