The contents of this folder have been copied from OpenVSLAM with
only trivial modifications like changed paths. Some of them, like other
OpenVSLAM files, have been inherited from other projects such as OpenCV and
have various copyright notices.

OpenVSLAM's code was originally licensed under a 2-Clause BSD License (included below),
but due to the licensing incident (https://github.com/xdspacelab/openvslam/wiki/Termination-of-the-release),
it may be that the license is not valid, and the code may actually be under GPL-v3 terms
from ORB-SLAM2 (https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2/blob/f2e6f51cdc8d067655d90a78c06261378e07e8f3/License-gpl.txt).
No-one knows for sure. Use for commercial purposes is not recommended.
